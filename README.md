If you add `SimpleUnzipper` inside your project dirctory, the `Import Paths` should be `$(SRCROOT)/SimpleUnzipper`

## Example

SimpleUnzipper is very simple as its name, contains only a few public properties and methods.

```swift
import SimpleUnzipper
...
// create an unzipper with file URL or data
if let unzipper = SimpleUnzipper(fileURL: url) {
  // or SimpleUnzipper(data: data)
  
  // get all file names, including paths if available
  let files = unzipper.files
  
  // check if a file available
  let isAvailable = unzipper.containsFile("path/to/file.ext")
  
  // get data from a file
  let data = unzipper.dataForFile("path/to/file.ext")
  
}
```
